# Blockchain based Certificate Generation and Validation

Project aim to create a decentralized system where custom digital certificates 
are generated and can be validated using 
blockchain technology.  
The system will provide a secure and tamper- proof way to generate and validate digital certificates. With the help of technologies such as Blockchain and advanced concepts, our system makes sure that the originality of the certificate remains intact, if it is generated by our system. All of these certificates shall be stored in Digital Locker System which can be only accessed by those who either issued the certificate or were the recipients of the certificate.  
The Blockchain technology used in this project makes it hard to manipulate a generated certificate, as we store the participants data into the Blockchain regulated by smart contract. With the advantage of the Blockchain concepts such as proof of work, smart contracts, distributed nature, Students and Organizations can be rest assured that the data integrity remains intact.
